Description: Testing dependence/correlation of two variables is one of the fundamental tasks in statistics. In this work,
    we proposed a new way of testing nonlinear dependence between two continuous variables (X and Y).
    We addressed this research question by using CANOVA (continuous analysis of variance) and developed its R package CANOVA.
    The C++ version of CANOVA software are also available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/canova/
    In the CANOVA framework, we first defined a neighborhood for each data point related to its X value, and then calculated
    the variance of the Y value within the neighborhood. Finally, we performed permutations to evaluate the significance of
    the observed values within the neighborhood variance.
